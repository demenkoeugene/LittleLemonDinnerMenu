# LittleLemonDinnerMenu
My completed project for the course "Advanced Swift Programming" by Meta

In this project, I implemented a menu for a restaurant Little Lemon.
I have created a grid layout to display layout data for food, drink and dessert menu items.
I embedded a right navigation button to open the "menu item options" settings page with filtering and sorting options (filtering and sorting are optional, but it's a worthwhile challenge).
Provides additional information about selected menu items when users interact with the menu.

Added the navigation bar button to the MenuItemsView. When you click on the button, the MenuItemsOptionView should be displayed. Inside the MenuItemsOptionView, there are two sections: the selected categories section and the menu items sorting section. Both sections should be created using enumerations.

I used enumeration, filtering and sorting with functional programming, and created simple unit tests
